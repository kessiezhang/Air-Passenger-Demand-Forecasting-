# Air Passenger Demand Forecasting

### Project Goal:

The ability to accurately forecast data is highly desirable in a wide variety of fields. Time series analysis allows us to forecast a future event through identifying trends and seasonal variances over a period of time. 

The goal of this project is to develop a time series model to forecast air passenger demand that could increase aircraft utilization. Utilization KPI is one of the most important KPI for Airline Operations. It is calculated as the percentage of checked-in passengers in relation to available seats of an aircraft. The method can be used to forecast cargo demand, sales, stocks, sports performance, etc. 

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)


### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory and run one of the following commands:


```bash
01 - Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb	
02 â€“ Time Series Forecasting Model.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data:
 [Air Carrier Payload Data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics](http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=259&DB_Short_Name=Air%20Carriers). (2010-2020)
